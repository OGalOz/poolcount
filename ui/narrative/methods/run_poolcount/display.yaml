parameters :
    poolfile_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Pool File
        short-hint : |
            The pool file related to these reads KBaseRBTnSeq.PoolTSV 
        long-hint  : |
            The pool file related to these reads may be the output from the MapTnSeq app.
            File type is KBaseRBTnSeq.PoolTSV
    fastq_files :
        ui-name : |
            Fastq file (.fastq)
        short-hint : |
            One of the reads files relating to the pool file
        long-hint : |
            Normally a result from Illumina- reads from the project return in fastq format.
    genes_table_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Related Genes Table
        short-hint : |
            The Genes Table Object related to this work
        long-hint: |
            The poolfile comes from a genome, genes table and fastq reads. Use the same genes table in this.
    KB_PoolCount_Bool :
        ui-name : |
            Create KBase PoolCount? 
        short-hint : |
            If yes, we create a poolcount object to be used downstream in KBase.
        long-hint : |
            Decide whether you want to create a KBase PoolCount Object. Defaults to Yes. 
    poolcount_description :
        ui-name : |
            Description 
        short-hint : |
            Give a brief description of the poolcount file.
        long-hint : |
            This description is saved along with the KBase PoolCount object.
    protocol_type :
        ui-name : |
          Protocol Type
        short-hint : |
          What is the indexing protocol you are using? BarSeq3?
        long-hint : |
          This method defines how the program looks for barcodes.
    max_Reads :
        ui-name : |
          Max Reads
        short-hint : |
          The highest number of reads to process within a FASTQ file
        long-hint : |
          The highest number of reads to process within a FASTQ file
    preseq :
        ui-name : |
          Pre-sequence
        short-hint : |
          (Custom) If you are using a custom protocol, write the pre-barcode sequence
        long-hint : |
          (Custom) If you are using a custom protocol, write the pre-barcode sequence
    postseq :
        ui-name : |
          Post-sequence
        short-hint : |
          (Custom) If you are using a custom protocol, write the post-barcode sequence
        long-hint : |
          (Custom) If you are using a custom protocol, write the post-barcode sequence
    doOff1 : 
        ui-name : |
          Off by 1?
        short-hint : |
          Compute off by 1 barcodes
        long-hint : |
    save_ignore_bool :
        ui-name : |
          Save Ignored?
        short-hint : |
          Save the ignored barcodes in a file?
        long-hint : |
          Save the ignored barcodes in a file?
    minQuality :
        ui-name : |
          Min-Quality
        short-hint : |
          Is there a minimum quality under which you ignore the reads?
        long-hint : |
          Set the minimum FASTQ quality value, under which you ignore a read.
    debug : 
        ui-name : |
          Debug
        short-hint : |
          Print extra values to debug.
        long-hint : |
          If there's an error, set this value to True to print more
    output_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output Set Name
        short-hint : |
            Your output name for the set (.poolcount) file
        long-hint : |
            This name must match the set name on your experiments file.
            No requirements besides no special characters or spaces. 
    test_local_bool :
        ui-name : |
