parameters :
    poolfile_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Pool File
        short-hint : |
            The pool file related to these reads KBaseRBTnSeq.PoolTSV 
        long-hint  : |
            The pool file related to these reads may be the output from the MapTnSeq app.
            File type is KBaseRBTnSeq.PoolTSV
    fastq_files :
        ui-name : |
            Fastq file (.fastq)
        short-hint : |
            One of the reads files relating to the pool file
        long-hint : |
            Normally a result from Illumina- reads from the project return in fastq format.
    genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Related Genome
        short-hint : |
            The Genome related to this work
        long-hint: |
            The poolfile comes from a genome and fastq reads. Use the same genome in this.
    KB_PoolCount_Bool :
        ui-name : |
            Create KBase PoolCount? 
        short-hint : |
            If yes, we create a poolcount object to be used downstream in KBase.
        long-hint : |
            Decide whether you want to create a KBase PoolCount Object. Defaults to Yes. 
    poolcount_description :
        ui-name : |
            Description 
        short-hint : |
            Give a brief description of the poolcount file.
        long-hint : |
            This description is saved along with the KBase PoolCount object.
    output_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output Set Name
        short-hint : |
            Your output name for the set (.poolcount) file
        long-hint : |
            This name must match the set name on your experiments file.
            No requirements besides no special characters or spaces. 
    test_local_bool :
        ui-name : |
            Developer testing
        short-hint : |
            Don't change this
        long-hint : |
            Always should be false
