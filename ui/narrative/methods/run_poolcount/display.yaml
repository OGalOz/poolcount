parameters :
    mutantpool_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Mutant Pool 
        short-hint : |
            The mutantpool related to these reads KBaseRBTnSeq.RBTS_MutantPool 
        long-hint  : |
            The mutantpool related to these reads may be the output from the MapTnSeq app.
            File type is KBaseRBTnSeq.RBTS_MutantPool
    fastq_files :
        ui-name : |
            Fastq file(s) (.fastq)
        short-hint : |
            One of the reads files relating to the pool file
        long-hint : |
            Normally a result from Illumina- reads from the project return in fastq format.
    genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Related Genome
        short-hint : |
            The Genome Object related to this work
        long-hint: |
            The mutantpool comes from a genome object, fastq reads and TnSeq model. Use the same genome object in this.
    KB_BarcodeCount_Bool :
        ui-name : |
            Create KBase BarcodeCount? 
        short-hint : |
            If yes, we create a barcodecount object to be used downstream in KBase.
        long-hint : |
            Decide whether you want to create a KBase BarcodeCount Object. Defaults to Yes. 
    barcodecount_description :
        ui-name : |
            Description 
        short-hint : |
            Give a brief description of the barcodecount file.
        long-hint : |
            This description is saved along with the KBase BarcodeCount object.
    protocol_type :
        ui-name : |
          Protocol Type
        short-hint : |
          What is the indexing protocol you are using? BarSeq3?
        long-hint : |
          This method defines how the program looks for barcodes.
    maxReads :
        ui-name : |
          Max Reads
        short-hint : |
          The highest number of reads to process within a FASTQ file
        long-hint : |
          The highest number of reads to process within a FASTQ file
    doOff1 : 
        ui-name : |
          Off by 1?
        short-hint : |
          Compute off by 1 barcodes
        long-hint : |
    minQuality :
        ui-name : |
          Min-Quality
        short-hint : |
          Is there a minimum quality under which you ignore the reads?
        long-hint : |
          Set the minimum FASTQ quality value, under which you ignore a read.
    debug : 
        ui-name : |
          Debug
        short-hint : |
          Print extra values to debug.
        long-hint : |
          If there's an error, set this value to True to print more
    output_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output Set Name
        short-hint : |
            Your output name for the set (.barcodecount) file
        long-hint : |
            This name must match the set name on your experiments file.
            No requirements besides no special characters or spaces.
