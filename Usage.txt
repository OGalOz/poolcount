This script analyzes multiplexed random barcode sequences, such as
nATCACGAG GTCGACCTGCAGCGTACG 20N AGAGACCTCGTGGACATCAGATC
for primer nATCACGAG (nLeading=1, indexseq=ATCACGAG), where the 20 Ns are the barcode

or, if -dntag is specified,
nATCACGAG CGGTGTCGGTCTCGTAG 20N CGATGAATTCGAGCTCGTT

or, if the index is specified, there is no multiplexing, and the read is
nnnnn GTCGACCTGCAGCGTACG 20N AGAGACC (where the leading ns are random and are ignored)

or, if -preseq -postseq -nPreExpected are all used, it expects a read of the form
   nPreExpected characters (any, although this includes the multiplexing tag unless -index is used)
   preseq
   barcode
   postseq

For a barcode to be counted, the preseq (9 nt upstream of the barcode)
much match exactly; the postseq (9 nt downstream of the barcode) much
also be correct unless minQuality = 0 (in which case the post-sequence
is not checked and there is no guarantee that the barcode is the
correct length).

If -minQuality > 0, then it also tries to estimate the diversity of the sample,
and the out_prefix.good file lists the "good" barcodes (not off-by-1 from
a more abundant barcode and with at least two reads). The "match10"
field shows if the first 10 or last 10 nucleotides of the barcode match
to a much-more abundant barcode; these are likely chimeras.
