Run python3 FullProgram, inputs are decided there.



We run MultiCodes multiple times, inputs to MultiCodes are decided at ...

In sample_run_dict.json, you can see the sample input dict to run MultiCodes
    and then a sample input dict to run CombineBarSeq

First, generate a list similar to "multi_codes_run_list" in 'sample_run_dict.json'
Then, iterate through that list to run MultiCodes.
Take a part of  the outputs from MultiCodes and add them to a list titled 
    codes_fp_list


How do the indexes work?
    Normally people use bs3
