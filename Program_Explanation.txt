Inputs:
   doOff1: boolean, Decides whether we write to 'close' file - which
            finds close barcodes (variants) for the barcodes.
   maxReads: Upper limit on the number of reads per FASTQ file, should only be used to test
             if FASTQ files work early on.
   minQuality: minimum Quality for all nucleotides within a read for the read to be used 
                and converted to a barcode. Default set to 10. If you set minQuality to 0
                we also don't estimate diversity nor bias (no basic statistical tests).
                Additionally, if minQuality is set to 0, then we don't check if quality
                scores make sense.
   debug: Print out debugging information - doesn't change program besides more reporting.



The program is divided into two main scripts:
"MultiCodes", and "Combine BarSeq". There are
no config json files, the config d is generated
in the impl file 'lib/poolcount/poolcountImpl.py'
*If your FASTQ files are not yet demultiplexed,
make sure to multiplex them, and have them named
such that the Index is part of the name of 
the file.
When we download the FASTQ files from KBase, we 
use the filenames to get the name of the index
associated with that file. This is done at 
the function lib/poct/downloader.convert_fastq_fp_list_to_add_index
*If using bs3 as protocol, index names must look like "IT001"  - "IT096"
    Or as listed in the lib/poolcount/barseq3.index2 file.
For the barseq3.index2 file, there are several columns which
mean different things - 
"index_name" - The name of the index
"index_sequence": 6 nucleotide sequence
"index2": 6 nucleotide sequence
"nN" - nN is the number of Ns in the primer (i.e., the spacing between the Illumina adapter, which is before the Ns and will not be part of the read, and the barseq primer, which is downstream of the Ns)
"primer_name": str
"primer": Sequence for primer listed in primer_name


"MultiCodes": At 'lib/poct/MultiCodes.RunMultiCodes'
        We get the DNA sequences 'preseq' and 'postseq',
        which are based on the protocol type. The protocol
        type also gives us the numbers nPreExpectedMin and
        nPreExpectedMax.
        
        How are preseq, postseq, nPreExpectedMin and nPreExpectedMax
        used? Suppose for a read that the preseq is found to start at location
        x within a read. If nPreExpectedMin <  x  < nPreExpected max, then we 
        continue; otherwise, we ignore the read.
        We look for postseq around the end of where the barcode is supposed
        to be. If we can't find it, then we ignore the barcode. Otherwise,
        we find it and report the length of the barcode. If the barcode
        is length 20, then we test the quality of the reads.
        



        If the FASTQ indeces were not yet multiplexed,
        make sure to make them multiplexed.
        There is a situation in which we use the index File
        instead of "indexname" for each, in that case refer 
        to "indexFile". Normally, we get a single index name
        per FASTQ file (If they were multiplexed). The alternative 
        would be to have the indeces mixed in a single file?

        For each read in the FASTQ file, we use the following
        to select whether a barcode is good:
        preseq, postseq, nPreExpectedMin, nPreExpectedMax 
        How we use them, is that 
        we look for barcodes
        by finding the expected presequence and postsequence
        at certain positions.
        The output ".codes" files have two columns:
        barcode, and the name of the index.
        For each barcode, there is the number
        of times it was found in the FASTQ file.



"Combine BarSeq": At 'lib/poct/CombineBarSeq.RunCombineBarSeq'

    We take the "codes" files from running MultiCodes and
    make a mapping from barcode to number of times it
    was seen per index, and note whether or not that
    barcode is found in the poolfile. Then we write a file
    that takes all the barcodes in the poolfile and 
    writes out the counts per index. Note that the poolcounts
    have the same barcodes as in the poolfile in the same
    order. Also, note that the barcodes in MultiCodes are
    checked against the reverse complement barcodes from
    the poolfile, and not the barcodes themselves
    (TnSeq and BarSeq read the barcode in different directions. 
    In the the pool file, "barcode" is what is seen during TnSeq, 
    and "rcbarcode" is what is seen during BarSeq).
