TD:
    Remove "multiplexing" feature from PoolCount to simplify it.



The program is divided into two main scripts:
"MultiCodes", and "Combine BarSeq". There are
no config json files, the config d is generated
in the impl file 'lib/poolcount/poolcountImpl.py'
If your FASTQ files are not yet multiplexed,
make sure to multiplex them, and have them named
such that the Index is part of the name of 
the file.
When we download the FASTQ files from KBase, we 
use the filenames to get the name of the index
associated with that file. This is done at 
the function lib/poct/downloader.convert_fastq_fp_list_to_add_index
*If using bs3 as protocol, index names must look like "IT001"  - "IT096"
    Or as listed in the lib/poolcount/barseq3.index2 file.
For the barseq3.index2 file, there are several columns which
mean different things - 
"index_name" - The name of the index
"index_sequence": 6 nucleotide sequence
"index2": 6 nucleotide sequence
"nN" - nN is the number of Ns in the primer (i.e., the spacing between the Illumina adapter, which is before the Ns and will not be part of the read, and the barseq primer, which is downstream of the Ns)

        We get the DNA sequences 'preseq' and 'postseq',
        which are based on the protocol type. The protocol
        type also gives us the numbers nPreExpectedMin and
        nPreExpectedMax.
        If the FASTQ indeces were not yet multiplexed,
        make sure to make them multiplexed.
        There is a situation in which we use the index File
        instead of "indexname" for each, in that case refer 
        to "indexFile". Normally, we get a single index name
        per FASTQ file (If they were multiplexed). The alternative 
        would be to have the indeces mixed in a single file?

        For each read in the FASTQ file, we use the following
        to select whether a barcode is good:
        preseq, postseq, nPreExpectedMin, nPreExpectedMax 
        How we use them, is that 
        we look for barcodes
        by finding the expected presequence and postsequence
        at certain positions.

    prefix: 
        Another thing we get is "prefix", a list of smaller 
        index-lists, where each sublist looks like 
        [nLeading (int), indexseq (str), name (str)].

        This list is extracted from a file 
        nLeading means 
        indexseq is
        name is
